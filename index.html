    <p>
        I'm Esteban Gallardo, a computer engineer with 20 years of experience developing
        multimedia, game, VR and mobile solutions. From small start-ups to corporations I've
        contributed with my expertise. Lately, I've explored the potential of AI in audio-book
        creation and virtual office simulations that test candidates' soft skills.

            In the beginning we needed to deploy the J2ME project from lower end devices to
            high end devices, a solid scalable structure was key in order to deliver to such
            wide range of platforms.

            With Unity the process of creating 3D worlds for mobile eased considerably. This
            new challenge helped me explore new creative ideas and later assist other
            developers as a freelance Unity programmer.
